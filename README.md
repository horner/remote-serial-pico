# About
Ever need a serial port far away from your Raspberry Pi? Wish you could use WiFi to talk to a serial device without having to run a wire? This project is for you.

## Installation

</a>

```
sudo npm i -g remote-serial-pico
remote-serial-pico i
```

Now a server is running on the Pi. If you plug in a Pico to the USB it will install the client code on the pico within 6 sec and make it a remote serial port.

`/dev/pts/pty1`

It's that easy to setup a remote serial port. Each time you plug in a pico, it will be the next `ptyN` on the list.

If you haven't already installed npm:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

### Background
Designed to facilitate communication between a remote device (such as a Raspberry Pi) and a device connected via serial to the Pico. It leverages TCP/IP networking to bridge data exchange between the Pico's serial interface and a networked environment. Extend this project using either the [`node-red-bridge`](https://github.com/RajkumarGara/node-red-bridge) or [`homebridge-tcp-smarthome`](https://github.com/RajkumarGara/homebridge-tcp-smarthome).

### Pico on-board LED status
* LED blinks repeatedly during the WiFi connection process. Upon successful connection it turns off.
* LED switches on again when connected to the TCP server.
* LED blinks once upon receiving a command either from TCP server or a serially connected device.
* LED turns off when disconnected from the TCP server.

## Project Details
* **Curious about PtyServer?**
    * Detects Pico clients upon receiving first packet with `pico_{N}`, and creates a pseudo terminal(pty) for each Pico.
    * Sends data available in pty to the respective Pico.
    * Writes data received from Pico into corresponding pty.
    * Log the commands and responses for each pico; check out the log:
        ```
        tail -f /tmp/smartHome.log
        ```

* **Wondering how plugging Pico into the Pi installs client code in Pico?**
    * The udev rule ([99-pico.rules](./src/99-pico.rules)) watches Pi's USB port for Pico connection.
    * When a Pico is connected, it triggers another script [PicoScriptDeployer.py](./src/pi/PicoScriptDeployer.py) to run on Pi.

* **And what exactly does PicoScriptDeployer do?**
    * It fetches `wifi-ssid, password, IP, Pico-Serial-ID` and updates the corresponding credentials on [config.json](./src/pico/config.json). You can also manually update it.
    * Deploys [`main.py`](./src/pico/main.py) and [`config.json`](./src/pico/config.json) to the most recently connected pico.
    * You can observe the deployer log:
        ```
        tail -f /tmp/deployer.log
        ``` 

* **Now, what's the role of the main code in Pico?**
    * Retrieves the network credentials and server details from the `config.json`.
    * Upon TCP connection, sends its `Serial-ID` to the Pi in the first packet.
    * Continuously checks for data in TCP and Serial; if it receives data from either, it sends that data to the other.
    * Sends a heartbeat signal (`PING`) to the server every 10 seconds to ensure the connection is alive; expects a `PONG` response from the server.

## Managing the PtyServer Service

If you need to restart the PtyServer service (for example, after updating code or configuration), use:

```
sudo systemctl restart ptyserver.service
```

To view the live log output for the service:

```
sudo journalctl -u ptyserver.service -f
```
